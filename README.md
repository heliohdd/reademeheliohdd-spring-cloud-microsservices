We would write and configure following spring cloud components:

1. Spring Cloud Config Server
2. Netflix Eureka Naming and Discovery server
3. Netflix Ribbon Load Balancer
4. Zuul API Gateway Proxy
5. Spring Cloud API Gateway Server
6. Zipkin Distributed Tracking with Sleuth and Rabbit MQ
7. Open Feign Api to Api Communication

To Demonstrate all the above component's functionality, we would write primarily our own microservices mentioned below:
1. Property Access Service
2. Product Stock Service 
3. Product Enquiry Service
